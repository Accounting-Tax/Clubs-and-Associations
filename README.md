# Clubs, Societies, and Associations 2024

## Tax Status
- The term "society, association or club" is not defined in tax law but takes its ordinary meaning.
- All incorporated clubs, societies, and associations are considered companies for tax purposes.
- Unincorporated clubs, societies, and associations not classified as partnerships are also treated as companies for tax purposes.

## Exempt Clubs, Societies, and Associations
- Certain non-profit organizations, including charities and certain religious, cultural, health, educational, and sporting organizations, can be exempt from income tax if endorsed by the ATO.
- Non-profit organizations cannot distribute profits to members or private individuals; profits must be used for the organization's purpose.

## Non-Profit Sporting Clubs
- s.50-45 exempts income of non-profit sporting clubs established for the promotion or encouragement of sports or games.
- To be tax-exempt, clubs must meet at least one of the following tests:
  1. Physical presence in Australia.
  2. Deductible gift recipient test.
  3. Prescribed by law test.

## Principle of Mutuality Exemption
- Under the principle of mutuality, a club cannot derive assessable income from transactions with its members. 
- Surpluses from contributions to a common fund created and controlled by members for a common purpose are not considered income.

## Assessable Income of Clubs
- Receipts from members, such as membership fees, subscriptions, and payments for services (e.g., bar sales, raffles, poker machines), are exempt from tax.
- Receipts from non-members, including income from services to non-members and investment income (dividends, interest, rent), are assessable income.

## Calculation of Taxable Income
- If the details of non-member receipts are known, taxable income is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Taxable Income} = \text{Receipts from Non-Members} - \left( \text{Expenditure} \times \frac{\text{Receipts from Non-Members}}{\text{Total Receipts}} \right)
  \]
- If non-member receipts are not distinguishable, the Waratah's formula is used to calculate the percentage of receipts attributable to non-members.
